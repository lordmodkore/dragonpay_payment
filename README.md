Dragonpay Payment Module for Magento

Dragonpay provides an alternative channel for purchasing goods or services from the Internet. Our online payment solution allow buyers and sellers to conduct e-commerce without the use of traditional credit cards or PayPal, which have very low penetration in developing countries such as the Philippines.

Instead, buyers can pay for their purchases through the following means:

Online Banking
Over-the-Counter (OTC) Banking
Over-the-Counter (OTC) Non-Banks
Online Banking allows anybody with Internet banking access to a local bank account, to make an Internet payment that is debited against that account in real-time. Customers enjoy a more secure online payment environment and convenient access from anywhere on the Internet. Currently supported banks include BDO, BPI, Metrobank, RCBC, Unionbank, UCPB, Chinabank, PNB, Maybank, RobinsonsBank, Sterling Bank of Asia, and EastWest Bank, with several more banks to follow in the near future.
